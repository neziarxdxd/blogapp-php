## What it does
Our project addresses the writing blog by doing an application that does blog writing with formatting for the ease of making blogs. 

## How We built it
Our team used **PHP, HTML, XAMPP+SQL, CSS, JavaScript,** and deployed our project to ```localhost```. for ease of access!

## Challenges We ran into
This was our first project that related to web development, We didn't know how to code before this semester! we didn't know how to reach the egress point of our simulated service. Whatever you ran into, overcame, or we're unable to solve, let everyone know here.

## Accomplishments that We are proud of
The download feature application, it is really awesome to see what you write is actually printable and downloadable
